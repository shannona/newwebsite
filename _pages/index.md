_What is RWOT?_ It's a new take on the classic model of a decentralized web of trust that was first suggested by PGP. Our goal is to create a community that can create decentralized models of identity and information, to ensure that we can remain in control of our assets, our accounts, and ourselves online!

RWOT consists of virtual salons and in-person design workshops focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. They're about germinating new ideas and producing finalized content that presents those ideas to the larger community. Virtual salons crowdsource inspiration and deliver statements, while design workshops produce at least five white papers on topics decided by the group to have the greatest impact on the future.

Please join us for our [next workshop](https://shannona.github.io/newwebsite/events/), so that you can contribute your expertise and have a say in the future of identity on the internet.
