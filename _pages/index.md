_What is RWOT?_ It's a new take on the classic model of a decentralized web of trust that was first suggested by PGP. Our goal is to create a community that can create decentralized models of identity and information

It consists of virtual salons and in-person design workshops focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. They're about germinating new ideas and producing finalized content that presents those ideas to the larger community.

Virtual salons crowdsource inspiration and deliver statements, while design workshops produce at least five white papers on topics decided by the group to have the greatest impact on the future.

RWOT has published foundational work on Blockcerts, DIDs, the BTCR DID Method, self-sovereign identity, and Verifiable Credentials.

Other topics of interest have included: credential wallets, decentralized data, decentralized identity, DID resolution, key recovery, local names, models for identity, object capabilities, offline credentials, online cooperation, peer-to-peer distributed networks, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), progressive trust, quantum security, reputation, selective disclosure, smart signatures, and trust metrics.
