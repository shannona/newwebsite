Rebooting the Web of Trust's mission is to empower individuals to co-create decentralized systems for lasting mutual benefit.

## Our Overall Purpose

RWOT reboots the classic model of a decentralized web of trust through organized collaborative gatherings. It consists of virtual salons and in-person design workshops focused on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. These events are about germinating new ideas and producing finalized content that presents those ideas to the larger community.

* Virtual salons crowdsource inspiration and deliver statements.
* Design workshops produce at least five white papers (or programs or other outputs) on topics decided by the group to have the greatest impact on the future.

RWOT has published foundational work on Blockcerts, DIDs, the BTCR DID Method, self-sovereign identity, and Verifiable Credentials.

Other topics of interest have included: credential wallets, decentralized data, decentralized identity, DID resolution, key recovery, local names, models for identity, object capabilities, offline credentials, online cooperation, peer-to-peer distributed networks, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), progressive trust, quantum security, reputation, selective disclosure, smart signatures, and trust metrics.

## Our General Objectives

Rebooting the Web of Trust is meant to:

* **Create Community.** Serve as a common meeting ground between various related technology communities.
* **Document Best Practices.** Establish shared understanding of the opportunities and pitfalls of decentralized identity.
* **Produce Content.** Generate white papers and other content to support the generation of empowering decentralized systems.
* **Evangelize.** Establish our output as foundational/influential to the future of decentralized identity.

Through these objectives, we hope to support the following outcomes:

* Build the next generation of Web-Of-Trust based identity systems.
* Showcase the scope of potential applications for decentralized trust models.
* Bring together the top contributors in web of trust and similar applications.
* Explore developing tools that might be useful to funders and researchers.
* Discuss and suggest requirements to drive adoption in the Web-of-Trust model.
