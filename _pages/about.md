The term "Web of Trust" dates back thirty years to PGP, where the "Web" referred to a distributed network of systems and the "Trust" was limited to the validation of keys. It revealed the need for decentralization and recognition on the internet.

Today, those needs remain, but the Web of Trust has grown larger, encompassing the creation, authentication, and verification of self-sovereign identities as well as privacy protection, reputation assessment, smart contracting, and more. The blockchain has come to be one of the most interesting and new tools for these tasks.

"The web-of-trust that began in Pretty Good Privacy was more than 'pretty good' in 1991 and even in 2001. However, as we approach the 25th anniversary of PGP, it is time to take the lessons we've learned and the new cryptographic technologies we've created to take a fresh look at the problem. I'm looking forward to collaborating to create a new foundation for next 25 years of the web-of-trust." <br>â€” Jon Callas, Director of Technology Project at EFF, former CTO of PGP

Rebooting the Web of Trust was founded in San Francisco, California in November 2015 as a global collaboration influencing the future of these technologies. Since then, workshops have been run from Santa Barbara to Toronto, from Paris to Prague, bringing these technologies to the whole world.
